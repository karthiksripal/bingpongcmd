# bingpongcmd
Command line tool for running Bing-Pong.
You can clone the repo or just copy the file to wherever. All you have to do is run the file.
If you want, you can run it from a Scheduled Task. The possibilities are real.

WARNING - This program forcefully closes Chrome. Make sure you save your tabs.

There are 2 files you may choose from: bing.bat and bing_simple.bat. Both will prompt you before starting. I have commented both extensively.

bing.bat
  This is the more advanced version. It allows you to use multiple user profiles for Chrome. Make sure you set the folder for the profile in the command.
  
bing_simple.bat
  This does the original - opens a flag-modified chrome in the default profile.
  
In both cases, the script will prompt you to kill the modified Chrome instances and start a clean one on the default profile. Saves you a few seconds.
